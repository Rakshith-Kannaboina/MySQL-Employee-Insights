üìä SQL Project Summary: Employee Data Analysis
This project involves cleaning, transforming, and analyzing employee data using SQL in MySQL. It demonstrates practical use of querying, joins, views, optimization, and data normalization for real-world analysis.



‚úÖ a. Basic SQL Operations
SELECT: Retrieved specific fields from the empdata table.

sql:
SELECT Name, Job, Salary FROM empdata;
WHERE: Filtered records based on conditions.

sql:
SELECT * FROM empdata WHERE commission IS NOT NULL;
ORDER BY: Sorted rows by salary in descending order.

sql:
SELECT * FROM empdata ORDER BY salary DESC;
GROUP BY: Grouped data to apply aggregate functions.

sql:
SELECT job, AVG(salary) FROM empdata GROUP BY job;



üîó b. Use of JOINS

Assuming a departments table:
INNER JOIN: Combined employee data with department details.

sql:
SELECT e.Name, d.Dept_name
FROM empdata e
JOIN departments d ON e.Dept_no = d.Dept_no;


LEFT JOIN: Listed all employees, with or without department matches.

RIGHT JOIN: Listed all departments, even those with no employees.


üîÅ c. Subqueries
Used subqueries for comparative filtering:

sql:
SELECT * FROM empdata
WHERE salary > (
  SELECT AVG(salary) FROM empdata
);


üìê d. Aggregate Functions
AVG() ‚Äì Average salary per job
SUM() ‚Äì Total salary/commission per department
MAX() / MIN() ‚Äì Highest and lowest salary in each department



üìÑ e. Views for Analysis
Created views to simplify complex queries and analysis:

sql:
CREATE VIEW avg_salary_by_job AS
SELECT job, ROUND(AVG(salary), 2) AS avg_salary
FROM empdata
GROUP BY job;

Other views created:
total_comp_by_dept
employees_with_commission
high_earners
dept_salary_range



‚ö° f. Query Optimization with Indexes
Added indexes to improve query performance:

sql:
CREATE INDEX idx_dept_no ON empdata(Dept_no);
CREATE INDEX idx_job ON empdata(Job);
CREATE INDEX idx_salary ON empdata(Salary);

Also created a composite index for multi-column filtering:
sql:
CREATE INDEX idx_dept_job ON empdata(Dept_no, Job);



üßº Data Cleaning & Normalization
Removed commas and invalid characters from salary and commission.
Converted both columns from TEXT to numeric (INT, FLOAT).
Normalized salary values to a range between 25,000 and 50,000.
Normalized commission to a range between 3,000 and 5,000.


üõ† Schema Changes & Maintenance
Renamed Dept no to Dept_no for SQL compliance.
Added and removed backup columns (original_salary, original_commission) during processing.
Used ALTER TABLE, MODIFY COLUMN, and DROP COLUMN to maintain structure.
